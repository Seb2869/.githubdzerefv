So you're looking to make some technical contributions? Before you drop in, read this:

### Meet your fellow shredders
If you haven't already, hop into the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gnars) and introduce yourself. Join discussions, share your progress, or swap stories about your latest adventures. The more, the gnarlier!

### Join the POD
Once you've made some friends and are ready to get to work, head to the [#contribute channel](https://discord.com/channels/928811922244137020/1073357014375350312) and submit an application for the "Tech POD". Your application will be manually reviewed and you'll be granted access to some additional contributor channels.

### Explore open issues
Take a look at the issues tab for any project and look for something that matches your skills or interests. When you find something, assign it to yourself and let everyone know in the [#pod-tech channel](https://discord.com/channels/928811922244137020/1026553205393477642).

### Fork, Code, and Pull Request
When you found something to work on, fork the repo, make your changes, submit a pull request, and let the rest of the tech POD members know so they can review your changes and you can collect that sweet, sweet dev cred.

### Have fun, stay gnarly!
